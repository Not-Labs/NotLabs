# Dreams of Memes

## 1 - Abstract
The user has a conversation with a group of fictional game designers regarding the design and development of a video game about memes or meme theory. The end goal being to produce a game design document. The game designers' dialogue and the final design document will be AI-generated using Large Language Models.

### 2.1 - Gameplay
The game will consist of multiple chat rooms with one developer each, whom the player can have a conversation with. The AI will decide when each conversation is over based whether a set of criteria has been met according to the AI's judgement. The AI will generate the final report when all the conversations are over and will integrate the results of each conversation.

### 2.2 - Implementation
The game is currently a singleplayer web game, but it may be an application in the future. The game will mainly be designed with JS, HTML, and CSS, and maybe some other language that is yet to be chosen when the AI is implemented.

### 2.3 - Presentation
The game resembles a generic chatroom with a large main window where messages from both the player and the game developers can be seen. There will also be a sidebar where the player can interact with the developers, check the instructions, adjust the settings, and talk to any of the characters that they choose to. Once all conversations are marked as complete the player can submit a report which will outline what the game (within the game) that the developers have made will actually look like. A UML diagram called proto-ui.PNG is in this repository in the folder (insert folder name here, after organizing code).

### 2.4 - Lore
On March 28, 2024 in the middle of a thunderstorm, a mysterious man with cybernetic implants, two dagger-like melee weapons, and a belt of red phosphorus grenades broke into the headquarters of a game development company, knocking multiple people who tried to prevent his intrusion unconscious by seemingly telekinetically manipulating a registered IKEA kettle. The man then gave one team of developers, which had recently appointed Radimir Trofimovich Pereprigun-Zaborov, a former police chief, as their chief designer, an ultimatum: the team had to create a game about memes, the DNA of the soul, within the next two months. If they failed to do so, the man threatened to return and kill everyone employed at the company headquarters for not having enough memes, citing the building's antimemetic properties as evidence that we live in a society.

The developers, no doubt confused by the mysterious intruder's threat and motivations, looked to Radimir for advice, as he was the only one who knew anything about memes. The first month of developing the game was chaotic and unproductive as none of the developers were able to agree on any features that the game should include, beyond that it would be a third person action-stealth game, which Radimir stated would have the most meme potential. In early May, the series of already bad thunderstorms was followed by a hurricane which forced the developers to stay home from work. With time running short, Radimir brainstormed some ideas and organized an online meeting with his team to try to get the game finished.
